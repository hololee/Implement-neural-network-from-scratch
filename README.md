<h1>Assignment-mid-term</h1>  

Build a neural network using python **without any machine-learning platform.**
  
_This project can be divided to 4 parts_
  

1. Build Neural network with out `tensor-flow`.  
(In my case, just used `scikit-learn` for load data.)

2. Test the Network by **changing the activation function**.  
(In this project, `sigmoid`, `Relu` are included.)

3.
